# System redis service

The `system_redis` service is a managed ***[Redis](https://redis.io/)*** database designed for general-purpose use. This service utilizes plain [Redis](https://redis.io/) containers without any modifications and comes with a default configuration.

!!! warning
    This service is not intended for storing large amounts of data persistently due to the limited RAM capacity of the Redis service. If you require long-term persistent storage, it is recommended to utilize the [`system_db`](./db.md). service instead.

## Keys naming convention

To ensure proper key management and prevent overlapping keys within the shared `system_redis` service, it is crucial to establish a consistent naming convention. This convention becomes particularly important when developing your own modules and services.

For your organization's modules and services, it is recommended to use the ***`external_<your org name>_<project name>_`*** prefix for all the keys. This prefix helps clearly identify and differentiate your keys from others, minimizing the risk of conflicts. By incorporating your organization and project names into the prefix, you create a unique namespace within the Redis database.

On the other hand, keys generated by OpenBP modules will have a shorter format and will directly start with the module name. However, these keys will never begin with the ***`external_`*** prefix.
