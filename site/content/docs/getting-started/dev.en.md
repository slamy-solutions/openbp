# Deploy for development
This deployment will be extremely useful for you if you want to develop core modules and services of the OpenBP.

!!! tip
    If you want to create an external module or configuration, it's better to use [docker-compose production](./prod/compose.en.md) installation.

## Prepare the environment
   1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
   2. Clone project using  ```git clone https://github.com/slamy-solutions/openbp.git```
